# sc2_saves

This is a collection of save files for the StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty campaign. The primary intention is to provide save files with the maximum amount of resources possible
for all missions that can be loaded for individual level speedruns. Those hunting for achievements on individual campaign missions may find the saves useful for similar reasons.

## Missions

* Liberation Day
* The Outlaws
* Zero Hour

### Colonist
